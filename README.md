## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the ERC-721 standard for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. This project demonstrates how to create unique, collectible assets compliant with the ERC-721 standard, which are commonly used in applications like digital art, gaming assets, and tokenized ownership of real-world assets.

### Key Features
- **ERC-721 Compliant**: Follows the ERC-721 standard, enabling interoperability with NFT marketplaces and other Ethereum-based systems.
- **Unique Ownership**: Each token has a unique ID and ownership, allowing for true digital scarcity.
- **Metadata Integration**: Includes optional metadata for enhanced functionality.

## Background

ERC-721 tokens are used for creating non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike ERC-20, where tokens are interchangeable and have equal value, each ERC-721 token is unique, representing distinct ownership. This project provides a foundational implementation of ERC-721 to facilitate NFT creation and experimentation.

## Installation

To get started with this project locally, ensure you have the following:
- **Node.js**: ^14.x or later
